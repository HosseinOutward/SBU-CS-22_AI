This course is mainly covering the famous
book, [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/) by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig.\

## Assignments and Their Deadlines

- Assignments score value will increase as the course progresses because the previous assignments will be used in the
  later assignments, and it's fair to give more score them.
- Report must be given in someway, either in a pdf file or even audio recording (upload either).
- If deadline is passed, 20% of the score will be deducted from the assignment at first and then 10% for each day until
  only 20% of the score is left.
- Common sense will be used when scoring (e.g. if you submit an assignment a little after the deadline, you will still
  get the full score; a few small lines of code was updated after deadline, you will still get full score).
- You can cooperate on the assigment and copy up to 35% of the code from other students, but you should write the
  rest of the code by yourself. (does not include the code for the AI algorithms like A* or BFS, etc.)
- teams of 2 people are not allowed as a whole, but you can work with a team of 2-3 people on some assignments.
- A software will be used to check the assignments automatically, and if it detects plagiarism of more than 35%, the
  score will be deducted.
