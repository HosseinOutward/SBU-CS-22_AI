- **Deadline**: NA
- **Report**: Not Needed
- **Score**: 1
- **Goals**: Learn to use BFS/DFS/IDFS and solve sudoku game with it.

- **Notes**: it is **ENCOURAGED** to copy BFS/DFS/IDFS from somewhere. but you should write the rest of
  the code by yourself.

## Description
Code sudoku game in a way that would fit the input criteria. This means that you should use code methods that will be
used by the search algorithms to solve the game. This might include win(state), possible_moves(state), 
make_move(state, action), is_valid(state), etc.

- There will be 2 levels of difficulty. choose a search algorithm according to Memory and Runtime constrains.

## Input
The program will get json data as input. an example of such json is available here (zero is empty):
```json
{
  "sudoku":
  [
    [3,0,0 ,0,6,0 ,0,0,4],
    [0,0,0 ,7,0,2 ,0,0,0],
    [0,0,5 ,0,8,0 ,2,0,0],
    
    [0,8,0 ,0,0,0 ,0,2,0],
    [9,0,2 ,0,1,0 ,6,0,3],
    [0,4,0 ,0,0,0 ,0,8,0],
    
    [0,0,7 ,0,5,0 ,1,0,0],
    [0,0,0 ,6,0,4 ,0,0,0],
    [6,0,0 ,0,2,0 ,0,0,5]
  ]
}
```
The program should return the completed sudoku as json data.

## Submission
While you can upload to courseware, you are **required** to upload to a gitlab
repository on [Roboepics](https://roboepics.com/).

There will be 2 parts which you can upload to. The only difference is their difficulty.\
To get the full grade, both must be completed.
