# Assignment 1
- **Deadline**: 1401-Mehr-08 23:59:59
- **Report**: Not needed.
- **Score**: 0.75
- **Goals**: Learn to use Google to find ready code, learn to use Git, github/gitlab, json data format and Roboepics.


- **Notes**: Copying code for sudoku from the internet is allowed and **ENCOURAGED**. but you should do the rest
yourself (input, output, git and etc.)

## Description
Write and submit a program that solves an easy sudoku (no technique required - only use row and column check).

The program will get json data as input. an example of such json is available here (zero is empty):
```json
{
  "sudoku":
  [
    [1,0,4,8,6,5,2,3,7],
    [7,0,5,4,1,2,9,6,8],
    [8,0,2,3,9,7,1,4,5],
    [9,0,1,7,4,8,3,5,6],
    [6,0,8,5,3,1,4,2,9],
    [4,0,3,9,2,6,8,7,1],
    [3,0,9,6,5,4,7,1,2],
    [2,0,6,1,7,9,5,8,3],
    [5,0,7,2,8,3,6,9,4]
  ]
}
```
The program should return the completed sudoku as json data.

## Submission
While you can upload to courseware, you are **required** to upload to a gitlab 
repository on [Roboepics](https://roboepics.com/).

This website will grade your assignment automatically, and you will get a score after a few minutes.
